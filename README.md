# SIMPs

## THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN IT'S BRAINSTORMING PHASE NOT EVERYTHING IS FINISHED AND THE PROTOTYPE HASN'T BEEN BUILT YET! ALSO THIS PROJECT IS BEING CREATED BY ONE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT SO THIS WILL TAKE TIME

### BASICS
The SIMPs are a very basic (and budget) set of smart glasses, SIMP stands for Super Intelligent Modification for Peripherals.

The SIMPs run on a Raspberry Pi 0 W, and uses a 2 inch LCD panel for a monitor. It also uses some basic phone parts such as a camera, microphone, and speaker. These are used to optimize the use to the maximum ability. Those can be found from any basic device that doesn't work anymore. 

### TUTORIAL
I will soon be making a tutorial on my YouTube channel to show how to make a pair of SIMPs.

### CONTAINS/ROADMAP
The SIMPs shall have (guaranteed):
  - Google Chrome (To search stuff up when you wish)
  - Voice Assistant (To replace a keyboard/controller)
  - Translator (Uses camera for auto translations)
  - Problem Solving (for basic things like Algebra/Definitions (also uses camera for full optimization))
  - Raspberry Pi 0 W
  - 2" LCD screen attached to lens
  - Camera
